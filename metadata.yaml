description: "Father and Son (1907) is a memoir by poet and critic Edmund Gosse, which\
  \ he subtitled \"a study of two temperaments.\" Edmund had previously published\
  \ a biography of his father, originally published anonymously. The book describes\
  \ Edmund's early years in an exceptionally devout Plymouth Brethren home. His mother,\
  \ who died early and painfully of breast cancer, was a writer of Christian tracts.\
  \ His father, Philip Henry Gosse, was an influential, though largely self-taught,\
  \ invertebrate zoologist and student of marine biology who, after his wife's death,\
  \ took Edmund to live in Devon. The book focuses on the relationship between a sternly\
  \ religious father who rejects the new evolutionary theories of his scientific colleague\
  \ Charles Darwin and the son's gradual coming of age and rejection of his father's\
  \ fundamentalist religion.\nAs Michael Newton, Lecturer in English, University College\
  \ London, has written, the book is \"a brilliant, and often comic, record of the\
  \ small diplomacies of home: those indirections, omissions, insincerities, and secrecies\
  \ that underlie family relationships.\" \"[B]rilliantly written, and full of gentle\
  \ wit,\" the book is \"an unmatched social document, preserving for us whole the\
  \ experience of childhood in a Protestant sect in the Victorian period....Above\
  \ all, it is one of our best accounts of adolescence, particularly for those who\
  \ endured...a religious upbringing.\"\nAlthough Edmund Gosse prefaces the book with\
  \ the claim that the incidents described are sober reality, a modern biography of\
  \ Philip Henry Gosse by Ann Thwaite presents him not as a repressive tyrant who\
  \ cruelly scrutinized the state of his son's soul but as a gentle and thoughtful\
  \ person of \"delicacy and inner warmth,\" much unlike his son's portrait. Biographer\
  \ and critic, D. J. Taylor described the latter as \"horribly partial\" and noted\
  \ that \"the supposedly sequestered, melancholic pattern of [Edmund] Gosse's London\
  \ and Devonshire childhood is repeatedly proved to have contained great affection,\
  \ friends, fun and even light reading.\"\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
